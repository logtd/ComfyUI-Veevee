# [ECCV24] SEA-RAFT

We introduce SEA-RAFT, a more simple, efficient, and accurate [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) for optical flow. Compared with RAFT, SEA-RAFT is trained with a new loss (mixture of Laplace). It directly regresses an initial flow for faster convergence in iterative refinements and introduces rigid-motion pre-training to improve generalization. SEA-RAFT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the [Spring benchmark](https://spring-benchmark.org/) with a 3.69 endpoint-error (EPE) and a 0.36 1-pixel outlier rate (1px), representing 22.9\% and 17.8\% error reduction from best-published results. In addition, SEA-RAFT obtains the best cross-dataset generalization on KITTI and Spring. With its high efficiency, SEA-RAFT operates at least 2.3x faster than existing methods while maintaining competitive performance.

## Requirements
Our code is developed with pytorch 2.2.0, CUDA 12.2 and python 3.10.
```Shell
conda create --name SEA-RAFT python=3.10.13
conda activate SEA-RAFT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Zoo
Please download the models from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YLovlvUW94vciWvTyLf-p3uWscbOQRWW?usp=sharing) and put them into the `models` folder.

## Custom Usage

We provide an example in `custom.py`. By default, this file will take two RGB images as the input and provide visualizations of the optical flow and the uncertainty. 
```Shell
python custom.py --cfg config/eval/spring-M.json --model models/Tartan-C-T-TSKH-spring540x960-M.pth
```

## Datasets
To evaluate/train SEA-RAFT, you will need to download the required datasets: [FlyingChairs](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html#flyingchairs), [FlyingThings3D](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html), [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/), [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow), [HD1K](http://hci-benchmark.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/), [TartanAir](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/), and [Spring](https://spring-benchmark.org/).

By default `datasets.py` will search for the datasets in these locations. You can create symbolic links to wherever the datasets were downloaded in the `datasets` folder. Please check [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) for more details.
